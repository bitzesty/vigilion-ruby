# Vigilion

This Ruby gem is for integrating with the [Vigilion Anti-Virus & Malware file scanning service](https://github.com/bitzesty/vigilion-scanner).

If you are using Rails, you should use our [Rails gem](
https://github.com/vigilion/vigilion-rails), which includes
integration with Active Record and Action Controller.

## Installation

Add vigilion to your `Gemfile` and then run `bundle install`

`gem 'vigilion'`

or install it by hand

`gem install vigilion`

This gem uses faraday as HTTP middleware, so you may use any HTTP
backend you want, `Net:HTTP` is the default.

## Configuration

You need to configure the client before making any API requests e.g. in an initializer.

```
Vigilion.configure do |config|
  config.access_key_id = ENV['VIGILION_API_KEY']
  config.secret_access_key = ENV['VIGILION_API_SECRET']
end
```
